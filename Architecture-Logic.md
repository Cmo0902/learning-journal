# What makes up a Computer?

I think i nerded out to this a little to hard, and really enjoyed knowing the specific inuances of the compute down to the most finite bit.  Here is my take away from the videos 

[Video Series: What makea computer?](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNcsRwJhvksEo1tJqjIqWbN-)

## 4 part of ANY Computer

1. **INPUT** - What the user does to tell the computer what to do. (keyboard, gps, microphone, camera)
2. **MEMORY** - Storage for the data  (byte - smalles piece of information)
3. **PROCESSOR** - (CPU) central processing unit; process the information 
    - Operating Systems: (i.e Windows, iOS, Linxu, Android) - Master program that manages software that uses the hardware.  Runs code to control things like _Load, run_
4. **OUTPUT** - Data that is sent out: text,photos, video, games, vr, robot signals, speaker, 3d printer, cutting machine

## Data & Binary
Binary is the language of just 0 & 1'S

binary (0 | 1) - bit: smallest piece of information CPU stores

 1: true

 0: false


> _Now, I love my Decimal number system (0-9) Math Baby, Yeah! -- this really blew my mind!

> _this is the point I really nerded out -- Matrix mode = 1_

**Decimal number system** - as we all know it

example: 1982 _yay for my birth year... Shhh!!!_

Number value placement: multiply by 10

 1000 | 100 | 10 | 1 |
 --- | --- | -- | - |
 1 | 9 | 8 | 2


 **Binary number system**
 
 Now, in Binary Number Sytem - the number value placement multiple  by 2

 1024 | 512 | 256 | 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 
 ---- | --- | --- | --- | -- | -- | -- | - | - | - | -  
1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 

- the result multiples each placement by its value (if its easier to remember if its a 1 - then just add those numbers together: 1024+512+256+128+32+16+8+4+2=1982)

And now how is everything Binary, like the Matrix?? 

Alphabet: each letter is represented by a number

Images: each pixel has a color, the rgb (red, green, blue) represented by a number

Sound: series of vibrations, graphically in waveform; represented by a graphical number.

## Circuts

> Now this just seems like fun to me, more logic!


- think of a light switch -- ON/OFF (0/1)

each circut has a wire in -- and gives an output based on information received. 

the circuts are more of the logic:

**AND**  - for this circut to be _turned on_ all the conditions need to be 1

**OR** - for this circut to be _turned on_ one of the conditions needs to be 1

and that is just 1 wire imputting information!

with 32 wires there are over 4 BILLION possibilites! 


## The possibilities are ENDLESS!
