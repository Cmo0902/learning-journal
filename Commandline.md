# Graphical User Interface (GUI) & command lines

GUIs are what the user interact with.  Think of the Windows File explorer, how you need to select each folder within directories.  

While GUIs are useful, the developer will use the command line to produce faster results. _Command line_, or _termianl_,  is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

The command line typically presents you with a prompt. As you type, it will be displayed after the prompt. Most of the time you will be issuing commands.
