# HTML
_Hyper Text Markup Language_ is the structure for webpages using semantic tags.

## Things to Remember when setting up a Website: 

- Who is this site for??  Target Audience: Individuals/Companies

 - _It maybe good practice to put together a list of hypothetical target audience (Age, Sex, Occupation, Income, etc.)

- Why do people visit your website? Key motivations and specific goals

- What are visitors trying to achieve on your site?

- What information do your visitors need? - Key Information (are they familiar? important features)

- How often will they visit? (Could be helpful set a schedule) -- Goods/Service vs Information


## First Steps

- **Site Map** - Create Section & Pages that will be relavent to your website (ex. Card Sorting)

- **WireFrames** - Simply Blocks of Content -- Does not include color shceme, fonts, images.

## Importance of Site Navigation

- _Concise_: quick and easy to read

- _Clear_: able to predict the kind of information they will find

- _Selective_: only reflect the section or content of the site.

- _Context_: lets users know where they are in website

- _Interactive_: Links should change on hover/click. visually distinct for other content

- _Consistent_: Keeping the same for easier flow, although sometimes secondary navigation is needed.

\<nav> | navigational block (links to places within the site or elsewhere)
\<article> | container for any section of a page
\<aside> | can be used in page or inside an article.
\<section> | keeps related content all together, can include its own header. 
\<hgroup> | groups together one or more \<h1> elements
\<figure><figcaption> | not just an image (Image, video, graphs, diagrams, code samples)
\<div> | related elements grouped together
