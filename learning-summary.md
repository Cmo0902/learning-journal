# What did we learn today?

Below is a quick overview of what we have learned on 
our first day of Coding102.

### _Sandbox Learning_ - Why it's important...
Sandbox learning is more of a hands on approach learning style.  
Think about being in a sandbox, creating a unique vision of your sand castle.  It may not be the approach 
your friend next to you does, and may look different.  But _YOU_ built a sand castle!!!  

Sandbox learnings hands on approach with give you the confidence to build things yourself.  Without limiting you to tutorials and open source files.  While those can be helpful, they can limit users. 

**Somethings to concider when new to coding**
- Generating/Selecting Ideas (What do you want to learn now?)
- Planning your learning (managing scope, finding recourses -- You're not gonna know it all!! Build yourself recourses - Its OK to use others stuff, doesnt have to be 100% yours!)
- Reflection (Pause every so often to tally what you've learned -- whats the new questions!?!)
- Find the HELP! If you're stuck for more than 15-20m, its ok to find help!


## Let's DIVE IN!!!
We got familiar with Gitub, by watching the [Pages](https://pages.github.com) video to get familiar with what the site does. 

### Creating Github Repository ###
[Click Here to startup Github](https://github.com/)

 _If you are not a user, setup a new user file to continue._

After we log-in, we created a new **_Repository_** _ - A location that stores our information_
We will name this "learning-journal"
`Username\learning-journal`
