## Growth Mindset 

When we first discussed _growth mindset_ the first word that popped into my head was **gumption**.
Having the courage and tenacity to keep moving forward, to take the problem at hand head-on and do whatever you can in your power to persevere. 

### Hey Cassy! Remember this about your growth mindset...

#### You WILL run into _CHALLENGES_ but you can embrace them!

Embrace that you are faced with a new challenge, seize the opportunity to learn from this moment/perdiciment in your life. 
Plus, it is _always_ ok to take a step back and breathe.  YOU'VE GOT THIS GIRL!!!

#### You WILL face _CRITICISM_ but you can learn from it!

No one thing is absolutely perfect! The world is filled with multiple world views and ideas.  It is up to you on how you handle your pride when receiving criticism.  If it is constructive, have an open ear and see the possibilities.  But please do not let negative criticism tear you down.  Sometimes, people just hate.  You have the intellegence to decern the two, just do so in a professional manner.

####  _OTHERS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL!_ Be Inspired by it!

The success of this world is piggy backed off others passed successes.  How can we learn and improve if others didn't succeed before us?!!
Use their success to be a drive for your own success.
