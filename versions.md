Revisions and the Cloud

Version Control
1. **Local Version Control** - one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files
2. **Centralized Version Control (CVCS)** - This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients.  Draw back: CVS goes down, collaborators cannot work with each other on a file or save changes and new versions
3. **Distributed Version Control** - allows clients to create mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information.
